<h2 id="the-inevitable-dumpster-fire-of-online-dating">The inevitable
dumpster fire of online dating</h2>
<p>For those who are looking for love on the internet, rather than
short-term flings, the online dating industry is a dumpster fire. This
has always been inevitable, given the nature of the industry.</p>
<h3 id="incentives">Incentives</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Show me the incentive, and I'll show you the outcome. - Charlie
Munger</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Online dating companies, whether catering for hookups or long-term
relationships, whether they have websites or apps, all share a single
overriding incentive: profit.</p>
<p>Everything else, even their purported "missions" to bring people
together, is subservient to their pursuit of profit. And every source of
income that these companies can utilise undermines the very pursuit of
long-term relationships for their users.</p>
<h3 id="making-money">Making money</h3>
<p>There are four main avenues of income for online dating services:</p>
<ul>
<li>Advertising</li>
<li>Pay for necessary features, such as messaging</li>
<li>Pay for digital "gifts", such as hearts or roses</li>
<li>Pay for premium features, such as advanced filters</li>
</ul>
<p>Advertising requires people to be using the site or app. The more
someone uses an app, the more advertisements they see, and the more
money the company makes from them. Thus ad-funded companies are clearly
motivated to keep users in the app for as long as possible, looking
around as much as possible.</p>
<p>Paying for features necessary for the user to actually succeed in
finding a partner means that the company profits more the longer users
stay on the app, are engaged with the app's features, but are ultimately
unsuccessful in finding a partner.</p>
<p>Similarly, paying for digital "gifts" to send to other users produces
more profit when users who send these gifts are unsuccessful in
attracting or sustaining the recipient's attention, so must continue
using the app, and perhaps buying more such gifts.</p>
<p>Paying for premium features shares the same core flaw as the other
revenue mechanisms, in that more money is made the longer a person is
using the app and desires to use those "advanced" features. This has the
further perverse incentive to make such for-pay features <em>appear</em>
useful or desirable, but for them to be ultimately inadequate.</p>
<p>All of these sources of revenue incentivise the companies to try and
keep people using the apps, rather than fulfil the desire of the user to
stop needing to use the app.</p>
<p>Consequently, this drive to keep users around means that dating
companies are incentivised to provide to users a large number of
<em>superficially</em> desirable "matches", to keep them hopeful and
interested; but which have poor long-term compatibility, to keep users
from leaving the app for long. This is fine and very profitable for
serving and encouraging a "hookup culture" of short-term casual flings,
but fundamentally incompatible with the search for a long-term
relationship.</p>
<h3 id="but...-the-testimonials">But... the testimonials!</h3>
<p>One alternative incentive which could be argued is the network effect
of endorsements from those who do have success finding a partner using a
dating app. However, marketing and search engine optimisation scales far
better than relying on word of mouth recommendations, and require far
fewer actual successes. That last part is important:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It turns out you are 12.4 times more likely to get married this year
if you <em>don't</em> subscribe to Match.com. - OKCupid, 2010</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Over a decade ago, it was documented in a <a
href="https://www.gwern.net/docs/psychology/okcupid/whyyoushouldneverpayforonlinedating.html">(since
deleted) blog post from OKCupid</a> that for-pay online dating sites are
less successful at fomenting relationships than the population average.
This was based on two of the biggest dating sites' own advertised
numbers.</p>
<p>(OKCupid was later bought out by one of the big dating sites
criticised in the blog post, and thus OKCupid eventually also faced the
inevitability)</p>
<h3 id="we-can-do-better">We can do better</h3>
<p>We see then, that the sources of income available to a dating app are
fundamentally incompatible with the objective of helping people form
lasting romantic relationships. It is also clear that a profit motive
will always push corporations toward more exploitative ways of
extracting revenue.</p>
<p>The fix for the latter issue is clear and obvious; that for a dating
app to ultimately be useful, it must be run by a non-profit entity which
has the explicit purpose of helping find and foster long term
relationships among people.</p>
<p>But even non-profits need funding to develop and support the services
they offer, so how could such an endeavour be financed, in a manner
where the incentives do not undermine their mission?</p>
<h4 id="investing-in-relationships">Investing in relationships</h4>
<p>If the purpose of a service is to produce long-lasting relationships,
then to incentivise that the most logical and direct system would be for
the organisation to receive payment so long as the relationship
persists. Thus, the longer a relationship lasts, the more the service
benefits.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I can't see any way such a scheme could be
implemented. I don't think adding a subscription payment to marriage
contracts would go down very well in any quarter!</p>
<h4 id="donations">Donations</h4>
<p>The default go-to for non-profit corporations are voluntary
donations. This is perhaps the source of revenue closest to the ideal as
far as incentives are concerned, as funding becomes tied to the general
public's experience of the usefulness and trust of the service.</p>
<p>That said, many, many, non-profit organisations struggle to maintain
enough donors to keep their services running adequately. However, a
service for finding relationships has understandable goals and a
universal appear amongst the general population.</p>
<h4 id="grants">Grants</h4>
<p>The "stable household" is frequently quoted as a hallmark of a strong
and prosperous society by many nations and civil society groups. It may
therefore be reasonable, for an organisation with the primary purpose to
create long-lasting stable relationships between people, to find grants
from public bodies.</p>
<h3 id="in-closing">In closing</h3>
<p>The current online dating industry is fundamentally broken for the
goals they claim to facilitate. Today's dating apps use deceptive,
abusive, and self-serving practises, which perpetuate and aggravate
human misery for the sake of profit.</p>
<p>Any upstart competitor which actually prioritises the promise of
getting people into lasting relationships above all, will necessarily be
getting people out of the dating pool, and therefore out of the dating
industry's potential paying user base. Thus we should expect that the
established industry powers will fight such a competitor tooth and nail,
by fair means or foul, in the media, the courts, and the lobbies.</p>
<p>So I hope that enough people with enough idealism, spite, grit, and
determination come together to upend this industry, but I'm not
optimistic.</p>
