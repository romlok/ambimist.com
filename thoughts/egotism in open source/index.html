<h2 id="egotism-in-open-source">Egotism in open source</h2>
<p>I have been a minor contributor in the free and open source software
(FOSS) ecosystem for many years, and an observer of its many trends and
controversies.</p>
<p>On occasion, I've observed project leads take umbrage with how their
project is being used, or with who has forked their project. I feel like
there is a fundamental misconception at play in these circumstances.</p>
<h3 id="freedom">Freedom</h3>
<p>Freedom is the key word when discussing FOSS, though I feel it is
often misunderstood as to what this freedom applies. Many developers,
and even project leads, seem to interpret it as "Freedom for other
people to use and improve my software", but this is a misconception.</p>
<p>While the legal terms of the license are necessarily framed in the
context of providing rights to other people than the original author/s,
the effective freedom granted is that of the software itself! By using a
FOSS license for your code, you are freeing the software <em>from your
exclusive control</em>.</p>
<p>Once a FOSS license is applied to a codebase, even if you have
written every single line of code in it, you are now just a member of
its caretaker community. Perhaps you are its only caretaker, but you are
no longer the code's master, its owner - the code has been
liberated!</p>
