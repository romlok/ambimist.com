<p>The following is adapted and expanded from a talk I gave in November
2022 at an internal developers conference for the company I worked for.
I'd been thinking a lot about coding styles, and had had an insight that
I wanted to share.</p>
<h2 id="coding-styles-are-like-assholes">Coding styles are like
assholes</h2>
<p>You may be familiar with the idiom:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Opinions are like assholes; everyone has one, and they all stink</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And I claim this also of coding styles. Why? Because they claim it
about themselves:</p>
<figure>
<img src="/img/coding-styles/opinionated-github-slide.png"
alt="A selection of GitHub projects describing themselves as &quot;opinionated&quot;" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">A selection of GitHub projects describing
themselves as "opinionated"</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The above is a selection of code formatting and style projects on
GitHub when you search for "opinionated". These are <em>only</em>
projects relating to code style and formatting, and <em>only</em> ones
on GitHub. There are many other opinionated projects out there, believe
me!</p>
<p>I have seen that not only these projects, but the wider software
community, seem to use the word "opinionated" as a badge of honour. As
if it is a good and virtuous thing to be opinionated. One of these
projects even gave themselves a <em>trophy</em> for being
opinionated!</p>
<figure>
<img src="/img/coding-styles/opinionated-github-trophy.png"
alt="A Go styleguide gives itself a trophy" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">A Go styleguide gives itself a
trophy</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>But if we think about the word, what does it mean to be opinionated?
It means to be biased, dogmatic, and arbitrary. In fact, if you look up
"opinionated" in a thesaurus, you will find a whole heap of words which
you probably don't want to see associated with your project or its
leadership!</p>
<p>Opinions are divisive, precisely because they are personal and
arbitrary. And when arbitrary opinions differ, there can be no
resolution but enforcement by authority. This leads to resentment and
division, and is a fuel of the "holy wars" that exist and persist in
programming and technology circles.</p>
<p>So if we shouldn't be opinionated, what alternative is there?</p>
<h3 id="ancient-greece">Ancient Greece</h3>
<figure>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true"><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_School_of_Athens">The School of
Athens</a> by Raphael, depicting famous classical Greek
philosophers</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Over two thousand years ago, the ancient Greeks were already studying
logic and reason, denouncing opinion, and seeking objective truth.</p>
<p>And humanity didn't stop with conjecture and rhetoric; in the
millennia since, we've developed our collective knowledge of
investigation, science, and research; and we today have the tools
available to us to find truths, to understand the world around us, to
find objectively better ways of doing things - and to find these things
beyond reasonable argument.</p>
<p>We who write software like to call ourselves "Engineers", and the
basis of what we do is indeed logic and reason - that's how computers
work! But a lot of what we do is still based on instinct, on gut
feelings, on opinions.</p>
<h3 id="rust">Rust</h3>
<figure>
<img src="/img/coding-styles/rust-style-team.png"
alt="Rust Style Team assemble!, Sept 2022" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true"><a
href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/inside-rust/2022/09/29/announcing-the-rust-style-team.html">Rust
Style Team assemble!</a>, Sept 2022</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In the early years of the Rust programming language, the Rust Style
Team was created to discuss and decide upon a consistent set of style
guides for people writing in Rust. Once the style guide was completed,
and the team's job done, the group was disbanded.</p>
<p>In the intervening years, the Rust language didn't sit still, with
new features being added, and knowledge and practices being advanced. So
the <a
href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/inside-rust/2022/09/29/announcing-the-rust-style-team.html">Rust
Style Team was re-formed</a> to update the existing Rust coding style
with guidance on how to use new features of the language.</p>
<p>Since I was already thinking about this subject, I took a look at the
announcement. What I found, buried in their <a
href="https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/3309-style-team.html">RFC-3309</a>,
was this small ray of light:</p>
<figure>
<img src="/img/coding-styles/rust-style-rfc.png"
alt="Snippet of Rust RFC-3309" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Snippet of <a
href="https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/3309-style-team.html">Rust
RFC-3309</a></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Among the sources that the Rust Style Team announced would be used to
inform their decision was research - into language transferability. This
is great.</p>
<p>It's a great start, at least. Because I believe that there is a great
deal more research that such a style team should be consulting!</p>
<h3 id="what-is-source-code">What is source code?</h3>
<p>As a software developer, what is source code to us?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>It is how we understand the precise function of an
application.</p></li>
<li><p>It is how we interact with the inner workings of
software.</p></li>
<li><p>It is <strong><em>our primary user interface</em></strong> to the
project we're working on!</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We as a society have centuries of research and investigation into how
people perceive the world around us, our common biological quirks, the
cognitive biases and shortcuts that our brains share, how we understand
written words and symbols, and how we interact with our environment and
the tools we make.</p>
<p>We don't have to rely on our feelings of the right way to do things,
when we have data available to that allows us to make reasoned
decisions.</p>
<h3 id="odd-one-out">Odd one out</h3>
<p>One of the cognitive shortcuts our brains provide is near
instantaneous and effortless recognition and classification of objects
based on certain characteristics, such as their shape. To demonstrate
this, we can play some simple games of spotting the odd one out:</p>
<figure>
<img src="/img/coding-styles/sushi.jpg"
alt="One of these sushi is not like the others" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">One of these sushi is not like the
others</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Here we have three pictures of sushi in different environments. Just
by looking at their shape, their construction, we can recognise that the
sushi in the middle is different from the other two. We don't have to
know the ingredients, the taste, the texture, or even the names.</p>
<figure>
<img src="/img/coding-styles/potato-ui.png"
alt="One of these UI elements is not like the others" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">One of these UI elements is not like the
others</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>If you've been familiar with computers for any length of time, you
will probably recognise the left two items as buttons. We don't have to
know what it says on the button, or even what language it is written in,
to understand that these are things which we as the user can interact
with to perform an action.</p>
<figure>
<img src="/img/coding-styles/reframe-code.png"
alt="One of these code blocks is not like the others" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">One of these code blocks is not like the
others</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Here we have some Clojure(Script) source code - blurred so we focus
only on the shape. One might expect that the bottom code snippet is the
odd one out here. This is obviously a trick question, however.</p>
<p>The odd one out is actually the first code block, yet we can't tell
that from its shape. When reading this code, to understand the nature of
each block, to understand what kind of concept the code represents, we
have to stop, read, and parse at least the first line of each block.</p>
<p>For reference, this is code written according to the <a
href="https://github.com/day8/re-frame">Re-Frame framework</a>. The
first block represents what is known as a subscription, while the bottom
two represent event handlers.</p>
<p>The reason I chose this particular example is because the middle and
bottom code blocks, which are visually distinct from each other, in fact
provide <em>the exact same</em> functionality! The middle block makes
use of a convenience function intended to reduce the need for
boilerplate, but in doing so it directs the visual shape of the
resultant code toward being indistinguishable from a something which is
conceptually very different!</p>
<h3 id="source-code-is-a-ui">Source code is a UI</h3>
<p>I hope it is now clear that source code is itself a user interface,
with which developers interact daily, and that how we design and arrange
the code can have a strong effect on how quickly and instinctively we
can understand it.</p>
<p>It may be rather unreasonable to ask all software developers to also
be UI experts (though I wouldn't object if this were the case!).
However, if you're involved in writing a coding style guide - whether
for a programming language, a library, or a whole application - I think
it would be a great benefit to have at least a basic grounding in the
principles of user interface design.</p>
<p>But whatever you're doing, whether you're writing code or not,
writing style guides or not, all I really ask is that you be
<em>reasonable</em>!</p>
