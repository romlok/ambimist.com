<h2 id="building-a-better-online-dating-service">Building a better
online dating service</h2>
<p>It has been my observation that the current state of online dating
apps and sites are not fit for the purpose of finding a long-term
relationship. As a software developer and habitual problem-solver, I of
course have come up with ideas of how a better alternative to the
current batch of apps and sites could be designed and implemented.</p>
<h3 id="principles">Principles</h3>
<p>In my opinion these are the principles that should underpin any such
design:</p>
<ul>
<li>Non-profit governance</li>
<li>Open and trustworthy</li>
<li>Private and secure</li>
<li>The user has control</li>
<li>Don't judge, shame, or assume</li>
<li>On purpose</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="non-profit-governance">Non-profit governance</h4>
<p>I described in <a
href="../the%20inevitable%20dumpster%20fire%20of%20online%20dating/">The
inevitable dumpster fire of online dating</a> how the sources of revenue
for a for-profit corporation all work against the idea of getting people
into relationships. Thus it is necessary that the governance of our
service be done through a non-profit entity which is not motivated by
acquiring money.</p>
<h4 id="open-and-trustworthy">Open and trustworthy</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Sunlight is the best disinfectant</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because finding one's life partner is a deeply personal matter,
online dating services are necesarily trusted with often very sensitive
personal data. This data is very valuable to many actors, especially to
those who may wish to harm or persecute people with certain attitudes or
preferences.</p>
<p>Thus any the organisation in the position of managing this data
should be open and transparent to maintain trust. The governance,
policies, decisions, and technologies should all be open to scrutiny by
independent third parties.</p>
<h4 id="private-and-secure">Private and secure</h4>
<p>In many places one's romantic and sexual preferences may be judged,
shamed, or persecuted by societies or authorities. Such oppressive
powers would desire to access this information either by agreement or
covert action.</p>
<p>And even absent such social or state pressures, humans are imperfect.
Mistakes happen, wrong decisions can be made, and personal pressures can
lead to acts of poor judgement.</p>
<p>Thus, any organisation in charge of protecting all this personal data
<em>should not be able to access the data</em>. This means that it
should be stored in an encrypted form where at all possible, with only
the owner of the data choosing when and to whom it is shared.</p>
<h4 id="the-user-has-control">The user has control</h4>
<p>No central authority can understand the needs and desires of every
individual in their entire community, and there is little more subject
to individual preferences than one's choice of life partner.</p>
<p>Thus, decisions such as what information to share, and who to share
it with, should be made by the individuals themselves, not decreed by
the service as a one-size-fits-all.</p>
<h4 id="dont-judge-shame-or-assume">Don't judge, shame, or assume</h4>
<p>Humanity is incredibly diverse. Not only in terms of our individual
preferences, but also in terms of what we and others consider taboo,
sinful, cringe, or icky. One should not be made afraid to be true to
themselves when seeking a partner, so a service for all should not judge
anyone for being themselves.</p>
<h4 id="on-purpose">On purpose</h4>
<p>That is to say, that the purpose of the service is to bring people
together in long-lasting happy relationships. So, from the sources of
funding to the details of UX design, all decisions and policies should
be assessed carefully to not diminish the pursuit of the ultimate
goal.</p>

<p>To be continued...</p>
