<h2 id="blocking-meta-from-the-fediverse">Blocking Meta from the
Fediverse</h2>
<p>I'm personally ambivalent toward Meta joining the Fediverse, however
I believe a large dollop of caution is well warranted.</p>
<h3 id="those-who-forget-history">Those who forget history</h3>
<p>Imagine for a moment if Microsoft entered a nascent market for user
interfaces to what I like to call a "world wide web". Due to the size of
their existing user base, Microsoft's implementation of the web
standards quickly becomes the de-facto accepted interpretation,
including all its bugs, quirks, and inconsistencies. Microsoft then adds
some new features, and websites start having to code specifically to
Microsoft's client, forcing competing clients to have to play to
Microsoft's tune or go out of business - or, eventually, both. The
subsequent Internet Explorer 6 era was not a great time for innovation -
or security - on the web.</p>
<p>Now imagine if Meta entered a nascent market for clients to display
what one might call a "fediverse". Due to the sheer size of Meta's
existing user base, developers will do their best to interoperate with
the quirks of Meta's implementation of the standard, no matter how
quirky, making Meta's interpretation the de-facto correct
interpretation...</p>
<h4 id="are-doomed-to-repeat-it">Are doomed to repeat it?</h4>
<p>Or look to the history of OpenID.</p>
<p>For a brief, golden, glorious time in the mid-2000s we had true
federated logins. I would post comments on random Wordpress blogs, and
sign in to Stack Overflow, by providing the site only my own website's
URL. Anyone could set up their own ID provider, or proxy one through
their own domain (as I did), and any website supporting OpenID logins
would accept it.</p>
<p>But you don't see that any more, do you? The only third-party login
options you commonly see are for the big identity gatekeepers - Google,
Apple, Facebook, Twitter. What happened to federation?</p>
<p>What happened is that the big identity gatekeepers got involved in
setting the standard. It got new, more complex versions, and it got
moved on top of OAuth. This de-facto killed the true federation, as each
website essentially then had to explicitly authorise every third-party
identity provider, else implement an optional extension that would
complicate their already complex authentication systems. And few are
going to bother with that when 99.99% of people will just use Google,
Apple, Facebook, or Twitter.</p>
<p><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embrace,_extend,_and_extinguish">"Embrace,
extend, extinguish"</a> is still quoted precisely because <em>it
works</em>!</p>
<h4 id="eternal-september-2023">Eternal September, 2023</h4>
<p>Even notwithstanding the possibility of deliberate action to
undermine true federation, Meta is the gatekeeper for some of the
largest online user bases on the internet. Should Meta choose to connect
one of these existing user bases to the Fediverse, they would more than
likely instantly create the largest single community on the network by
far. The majority of this community will likely know little about
federation, and care about it even less.</p>
<p>When a large group of people arrives in a more sparsely populated
region, the sheer numbers of the newcomers tend to push out and
marginalise the peoples and cultures who lived there before - either
through insular disinterest, or deliberate self-assured action.</p>
<p>Thirty years on, will the Fediverse suffer its own <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_September">Eternal
September</a>?</p>
<h3 id="should-meta-be-blocked-from-joining-your-network">Should Meta be
blocked from joining your network?</h3>
<p>Were Meta to join the Fediverse, the sheer quantity of users,
developers, and societal clout at their disposal would provide them an
enormous amount of influence over the evolution of the network, and
ActivityPub as a standard.</p>
<p>Do you trust that Meta will be a good citizen of the network? Does
the network have procedures and systems in place to prevent one or a
small number of powerful parties from dominating?</p>
