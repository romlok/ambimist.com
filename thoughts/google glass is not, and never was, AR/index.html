<h2 id="google-glass-is-not-and-never-was-ar">Google Glass is not, and
never was, AR</h2>
<p>When I see people talk about head-mounted products which sport AR
("augmented reality") functionality, such as the recently announced
Apple Vision Pro, I see them frequently mention Google Glass as an early
entry into the AR device space. This is absolute nonsense.</p>
<p>Google Glass does not provide any augmented reality features. All it
is, and has been, is a second screen. By the functionality it provides
the wearer, it's in a similar category to smart watches.</p>
<p>For something to be an augmented reality device, it has to
<em>augment reality</em>. That means adding things to one's perception
of the world that aren't really there, or removing things that are. This
requires anchoring (eg. visually) the augmentation to a relative
position in the real world.</p>
<p>Google Glass just provides a second screen, a kind of HUD (head-up
display) that can show information. Thanks to its camera, this may even
be related to what is in front of the wearer. However, the information
may be <em>derived</em> from the world, but the design of the hardware -
the position of the screen - means it cannot <em>augment</em> the
world.</p>
<p>Just because information is presented on a transparent screen, does
not make it AR. Otherwise, stencilling the name of a restaurant on its
window would also count as AR. Or those mirrors with the little
moustache drawn on them.</p>
<p>None of these are augmenting reality - they just <em>are</em>
reality.</p>
