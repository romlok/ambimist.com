I'm a professional sofware developer.  I work mostly in the web domain, but occasionally tinker with video game development.  I'm an advocate for software freedom and human rights.

I am fundamentally an optimist, who believes that people are mostly good, and problems can and will be solved.  However, experience teaches that things don't turn out as well as wanted, or as quickly as desired.  But in the end, it'll be okay.  Not great, just okay.
