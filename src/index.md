I'm a professional sofware developer.  I work mostly in the web domain, but occasionally tinker with video game development.  I am a long-time Linux user, and an advocate for software freedom.  I spend a lot of time thinking, but only occasionally writing.

I could be described as an ambimist.  I am fundamentally an optimist, who believes that people are mostly good, and that our problems can and will be solved.  However experience teaches that things won't turn out as perfectly as hoped, as quickly as wanted, nor in the manner desired.  But in the end, it'll be okay.  Not great, just okay.
