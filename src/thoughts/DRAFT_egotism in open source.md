## Egotism in open source

I have been a minor contributor in the free and open source software (FOSS) ecosystem for many years, and an observer of its many trends and controversies.

On occasion, I've observed project leads take umbrage with how their project is being used, or with who has forked their project.  I feel like there is a fundamental misconception at play in these circumstances.

### Freedom

Freedom is the key word when discussing FOSS, though I feel it is often misunderstood as to what this freedom applies.  Many developers, and even project leads, seem to interpret it as "Freedom for other people to use and improve my software", but this is a misconception.

While the legal terms of the license are necessarily framed in the context of providing rights to other people than the original author/s, the effective freedom granted is that of the software itself!  By using a FOSS license for your code, you are freeing the software _from your exclusive control_.

Once a FOSS license is applied to a codebase, even if you have written every single line of code in it, you are now just a member of its caretaker community.  Perhaps you are its only caretaker, but you are no longer the code's master, its owner - the code has been liberated!
