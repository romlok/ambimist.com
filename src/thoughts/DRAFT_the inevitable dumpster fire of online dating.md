## The inevitable dumpster fire of online dating

For those who are looking for love on the internet, rather than short-term flings, the online dating industry is a dumpster fire.  This has always been inevitable, given the nature of the industry.

### Incentives

> Show me the incentive, and I'll show you the outcome

Online dating companies, whether catering for hookups or long-term relationships, whether they have websites or apps, all share a single overriding incentive: profit.

Everything else, even their purported "missions" to bring people together, is subservient to their pursuit of profit.  And every source of income that these companies can utilise undermines the very pursuit of long-term relationships in their users.

There are four main avenues of income for online dating companies:

* Advertising
* Pay for necessary features, such as messaging
* Pay for "gifts", such as hearts or stickers
* Pay for premium features, such as advanced filters

Advertising requires people to be using the site or app. The more someone uses an app, the more advertisements they see, and the more money the company makes from them.  Thus ad-funded companies are clearly motivated to keep users in the app for as long as possible, looking around as much as possible.

Paying for features necessary for the user to actually succeed in finding a partner means that the company profits more the longer users stay on the app, are engaged with the app's features, but are ultimately unsuccessful in finding a partner.

Similarly, paying for digital "gifts" to send to other users produces more profit when users who send these gifts are unsuccessful in attracting or sustaining the recipient's attention, so must continue using the app, and perhaps buying more such gifts.

Paying for premium features shares the same core flaw as the other revenue mechanisms, in that more money is made the longer a person is using the app and desires to use those "advanced" features.  This has the further perverse incentive to make such for-pay features _appear_ useful or desirable, but for them to be ultimately inadequate.

All of these sources of revenue incentivise the companies to try and keep people using the apps, rather than fulfil the desire of the user to stop needing to use the app.

Consequently, this drive to keep users around means that dating companies are incentivised to provide to users a large number of _superficially_ desirable "matches", but who have poor compatibility of personality.  This is fine for serving and encouraging a "hookup culture" of short-term casual flings, but fundamentally incompatible with the search for a long-term relationship.
