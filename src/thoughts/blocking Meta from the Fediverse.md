## Blocking Meta from the Fediverse

I'm personally ambivalent toward Meta joining the Fediverse, however I believe a large dollop of caution is well warranted.

Any Meta service which suddenly starts communicating with the Fediverse will likely have a user base that would be by far the largest single community on the network.  And the majority of this community will likely know little about federation, and care about it even less.

Should Meta join the Fediverse, the sheer quantity of users and developers at their disposal would provide them an enormous amount of influence over the evolution of the network, and ActivityPub as a standard.

### Those who forget history

Imagine for a moment if Microsoft entered a nascent market for user interfaces to what I like to call a "world wide web".  Due to the size of their existing user base, Microsoft's implementation of the web standards quickly becomes the de-facto accepted interpretation, including all its bugs, quirks, and inconsistencies.  Microsoft then adds some new features, and websites start having to code specifically to Microsoft's client, forcing competing clients to have to play to Microsoft's tune or go out of business - or both.

Now imagine if Meta entered a nascent market for clients to display what one might call a "fediverse".  Due to the sheer size of Meta's existing user base, developers will do their best to interoperate with the quirks of Meta's implementation of the standard, no matter how quirky, making Meta's interpretation the de-facto correct interpretation.

#### Are doomed to repeat it?

Or look to the history of OpenID.

For a brief, golden, glorious time in the mid-2000s we had true federated logins.  I would post comments on random Wordpress blogs, and sign in to Stack Overflow, by providing the site only my own website's URL.  Anyone could set up their own ID provider, or proxy one through their own domain (as I did), and any website supporting OpenID logins would accept it.

But you don't see that any more, do you?  The only third-party login options you commonly see are for the big identity gatekeepers - Google, Apple, Facebook, Twitter.  What happened to federation?

What happened is that the big identity gatekeepers got involved in setting the standard.  It got new, more complex versions, and it got moved on top of OAuth.  This de-facto killed the true federation, as each website essentially then had to explicitly authorise each third-party identity provider.  And few are going to bother with that when 99% of people will be using Google, Apple, Facebook, or Twitter.

### Should Meta be blocked from joining your network?

If Meta joins a community social network, they are likely to be the most powerful entity in that network.  Do you trust that they'll be good citizens of the network?  Does your network have procedures and systems in place to prevent a single party dominating?
