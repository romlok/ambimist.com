## Building a better online dating service

It has been my observation that the current state of online dating apps and sites are not fit for the purpose of finding a long-term relationship.  As a software developer and habitual problem-solver, I of course have come up with ideas of how a better alternative to the current batch of apps and sites could be designed and implemented.


### Principles

In my opinion these are the principles that should underpin any such design:

* Non-profit governance
* Open and trustworthy
* Private and secure
* The user has control
* Don't judge, shame, or assume
* On purpose


#### Non-profit governance

I described in [The inevitable dumpster fire of online dating](../the inevitable dumpster fire of online dating/) how the sources of revenue for a for-profit corporation all work against the idea of getting people into relationships.  Thus it is necessary that the governance of our service be done through a non-profit entity which is not motivated by acquiring money.


#### Open and trustworthy

> Sunlight is the best disinfectant

Because finding one's life partner is a deeply personal matter, online dating services are necesarily trusted with often very sensitive personal data.  This data is very valuable to many actors, especially to those who may wish to harm or persecute people with certain attitudes or preferences.

Thus any the organisation in the position of managing this data should be open and transparent to maintain trust.  The governance, policies, decisions, and technologies should all be open to scrutiny by independent third parties.


#### Private and secure

In many places one's romantic and sexual preferences may be judged, shamed, or persecuted by societies or authorities.  Such oppressive powers would desire to access this information either by agreement or covert action.

And even absent such social or state pressures, humans are imperfect.  Mistakes happen, wrong decisions can be made, and personal pressures can lead to acts of poor judgement.

Thus, any organisation in charge of protecting all this personal data *should not be able to access the data*.  This means that it should be stored in an encrypted form where at all possible, with only the owner of the data choosing when and to whom it is shared.


#### The user has control

No central authority can understand the needs and desires of every individual in their entire community, and there is little more subject to individual preferences than one's choice of life partner.

Thus, decisions such as what information to share, and who to share it with, should be made by the individuals themselves, not decreed by the service as a one-size-fits-all.


#### Don't judge, shame, or assume

Humanity is incredibly diverse. Not only in terms of our individual preferences, but also in terms of what we and others consider taboo, sinful, cringe, or icky.  One should not be made afraid to be true to themselves when seeking a partner, so a service for all should not judge anyone for being themselves.


#### On purpose

That is to say, that the purpose of the service is to bring people together in long-lasting happy relationships.  So, from the sources of funding to the details of UX design, all decisions and policies should be assessed carefully to not diminish the pursuit of the ultimate goal.


### The design
