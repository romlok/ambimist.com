<h2 id="bag-of-looting-postmortem">Bag of Looting postmortem</h2>
<p><img src="/img/bag-of-looting/rip.png" /></p>
<p>I'm not really sure how game postmortems are generally structured, so
I'm just going to write out some of the thoughts I collected during and
after development.</p>
<h3 id="the-very-first">The very first</h3>
<p>Bag of Looting was the very first game I'd been able to stick with
long enough for it to become what I could describe as a "complete" game;
eg. having menus, graphics, sound, a start, a progression, and an
end.</p>
<p>Mostly, my game projects are focused around implementing a single
technical or mechanical challenge, after which I lose interest or
motivation. This is why I've described myself as a tinkerer in video
game development, rather than a game developer.</p>
<h3 id="not-a-success">Not a success?</h3>
<p>Obviously I wasn't intending to make a commercial success out of the
game, since I released it for free. It hasn't really had any attention
either (not even among the friends that I asked to test it! ðŸ˜›), which
is also expected since I put in next to zero effort in publicising it -
and what small effort I made was all on niche platforms like <a
href="https://toot.io/@ambimist">Mastodon</a> and <a
href="https://libera.chat">IRC</a>.</p>
<p>And that's all okay, because the point of the project was to prove to
myself that I could make a game, not to become rich or famous. So in
that sense it was absolutely a success!</p>
<h3 id="i-dont-sound-so-good">I don't sound so good</h3>
<p>I'm a coder, by profession and by inclination. It's what I'm good at,
and what I love.</p>
<p>I enjoy drawing and CG visual art, though I don't claim to have the
experience to be good at doing either.</p>
<p>But I know next to nothing about making audio. The credits screen of
Bag of Looting makes this clear, where the sounds and music are the only
parts I didn't create myself. I would've liked to create all the music
and foley audio for the game as well - just to say that I did - but I
wanted <em>some</em> baseline level of quality, and I have neither the
equipment, the tooling, the skills, nor had the time to become "good
enough" for my own standards!</p>
<p>So audio and music creation is something I've a mind to learn more
about, but given the low priority I generally give to audio quality in
the content I consume (I usually listen with monitor speakers or cheap
stereo headphones from 10 years ago), I would have a long road ahead on
that journey!</p>
<h3 id="motivation">Motivation</h3>
<p>I have an issue with motivation. As mentioned, I tend to lose
interest after solving a core technical challenge in a project. Or,
rather, after solving a technical challenge for a game idea, my
brainpower gets freed up and starts wandering to and obsessing over
other game ideas or technical challenges.</p>
<p>The original idea for Bag of Looting came about three years ago, and
I built a prototype of the core gameplay loop. And with that done, I
lost interest. Or perhaps I just resumed being mentally exhausted from
my job, I'm not sure. Either way, the project died there like so many of
my others.</p>
<p>Then my job evaporated in June 2023, and I found myself with a few
months of free time, nothing to do, nothing public to demonstrate my
skills in ~5 years, and a pressing desire to distract myself from the
dread of imminently having to find a new job.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I'd been sharing videos of my occasional game prototypes
privately with my colleagues, so it was a simple decision to sign up to
a PeerTube instance and make that archive footage publicly visible.</p>
<p>The resultant "<a
href="https://spectra.video/w/fXJDR56pnhjRQLp9jZGaSa">Inventory-tetris
autobattler prototype</a>" video got a single comment: "Fun idea". It
wasn't much, but getting acknowledgement of the idea from this solitary
stranger really did help cement my commitment to reviving and following
through on the project.</p>
<p>So if you take anything away from this article, let it be to remember
that even small actions can be great encouragements!</p>
<h3 id="dropping-logs">Dropping logs</h3>
<p>One thing that I credit with keeping me motivated and the project
running, were the dev logs.</p>
<p>During development of the game, about every week as it happened, I
uploaded a new alpha version and an accompanying dev log. Sometimes I
really didn't want to write about what I'd done - I find it far more
interesting to create new stuff, than write about stuff I've already
more or less forgotten I'd done. But once I'd started publishing them, I
felt a pressure to continue writing and publishing the dev logs for the
duration - lest people<sup>[who?]</sup> think I'd been slacking or had
given up.</p>
<p>Overall, I think the dev logs helped entrench the feeling that
progress was being made. What I'd done was no longer just lines in a
commit log, but words and screenshots and videos. Writing the logs
forced me to recognise what I had accomplished in the preceding week.
This served as a great motivator, even if nobody would ever read the
articles!</p>
<h3 id="disciplining-myself">Disciplining myself</h3>
<p>However, the main thing that kept me on-task was my <code>PLAN</code>
file. It was a simple text document where I listed what I intended to do
next, as well as the next milestone (alpha-n, beta-n, release), and a
grab-bag list of ideas for functionality.</p>
<p>On previous projects, I have kept plans pretty much in my head (aside
from scattered TODOs in the source code). This is possibly why I get so
easily distracted after completing significant challenges - the plan in
my head gets pushed out by the mental effort and forgotten! So just
tracking "what I intend to fix tomorrow" was a major boon for making
progress.</p>
<p>The "next steps" section of the <code>PLAN</code> was what I was
actively working on, and what I intended to complete in the next day or
so. It was intentionally <em>very</em> short term, and used mostly to
remind myself "what was I doing again?" after getting distracted by
uncovering bugs (which would also get added to the "next steps").</p>
<p>If the "next steps" section became empty, I would transfer one or two
items from the milestone to it. Once the milestone became empty, I would
build, publish, and write up the changes; before deciding on what of the
wishlist functionality made sense for the next milestone.</p>
<p>I had quickly abandoned any idea of planning for any milestone but
the very next one. I find it's far too easy to start scope-creeping
myself, and thereby getting disillusioned and demotivated by how much
more there is to do. Dealing with just one milestone at a time I found
kept me from being overwhelmed in the face of all my ideas, while
providing clear markers of progress.</p>
<p>While my development was always focused on a single fixed milestone,
the wishlist could constantly grow with ideas without me giving it much
concern. It was only toward the end of the project, as I noticed my
motivation was flagging and my distractability was increasing, that I
decided on what was actually necessary for me to consider it a
"complete" game, and took a hatchet to everything out of scope.</p>
<h3 id="making-a-mess">Making a mess</h3>
<p>As a developer I like to make my code simple, straight-forward, and
thereby understandable even when tired. But I also consider how
functionality could be used beyond the immediate case, including how it
could be misused or used in error. And consolidating these two drives
takes significantly more time and effort than just bodging things
together, especially in something so multi-faceted and asynchronous as a
video game.</p>
<p>So it came something as a relief when I'd brought down the hatchet,
and the final set of features was decided upon. My brain no longer
concerned itself with other possible uses of functionality, nor was I so
revulsed at hard-coding certain special-cases and generally making a
mess. I knew that, once the final milestone was completed, I'd never
need to add to or extend that code again! ðŸ˜Œ</p>
<p>I certainly won't say that one should take that attitude for interim
milestones - or even a release - if you have any intention to continue
development at some point. Refactoring code to more abstracted concepts
saved my sanity on several occasions during the alphas. But if you never
intend to come back to a project, I'd say go nuts!</p>
<h3 id="drooping-features">Drooping features</h3>
<p>As I mentioned, in the end I axed a lot of things I thought were neat
ideas to add to the game.</p>
<p>Most of all, I'm still kinda dissatisfied with the shape variety in
the game. Most of the items you find are just one or two tiles in size,
and very few are 2-dimensional. This makes the inventory-organisation
aspect less challenging, and less interesting, since items can commonly
just be stacked vertically with no gaps or overhangs - even when deeply
buried items are equipped and removed from the grid.</p>
<p>Otherwise, in case anyone else is inspired to make something similar,
but bigger and better, some of the ideas that I cut include: a tutorial,
branching dungeons, encounters which accept items (eg. using keys on
side-doors), traps, clothing/armour, true 3D dungeon with shadows and
stuff, puddles.</p>
<h3 id="bugging-out">Bugging out</h3>
<p>There are also a couple of known bugs that I left in the released
game ðŸ™ˆ</p>
<p>The most annoying one is that, for reasons I wasn't able to discern
over multiple debugging attempts, you sometimes simply can't select
items in the bag. Items glow when the mouse hovers them, but the glow
disappears as soon as you click to select. Then at some point in the
gameplay, it starts working again! ðŸ¤·</p>
<p>The other one is that the main menu music sometimes doesn't play
properly, or at all. I only encountered it occasionally when bouncing
back and forth around the menu and game, and since it didn't seem to
affect the main happy paths, I didn't spend much time looking into
it!</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Bag of Looting is not all I wanted it to be. I imagined it being so
much bigger, with more depth, and much more polish.</p>
<p>But it's done, and I'm happy with that. ðŸ˜Š</p>
