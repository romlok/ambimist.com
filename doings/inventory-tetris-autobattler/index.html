<p>Watching streamers play <a
href="https://www.escapefromtarkov.com/">Escape from Tarkov</a> and
seeing how much time they spent sorting and rearranging their inventory,
when compared to time spent actually playing the game, it inspired me to
wonder "what if sorting the inventory <em>was</em> the game? What if the
raids were just played out automatically?"</p>
<p>It seems like Resident Evil fans are all over inventory organisation,
with games like <a
href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1955330/Save_Room__Organization_Puzzle/">Save
Room</a>, and <a
href="https://old.reddit.com/r/residentevil/comments/uxqjvg/resident_evil_4_tetris_edition_fangame_i_made/">random
fan games with falling blocks</a>.</p>
<p>However, I could find no game which combined the challenge of
arranging Tetris-like falling shapes with the metagame of an
autobattler.</p>
<p>Others later followed through on similar ideas, such as <a
href="https://thejaspel.itch.io/backpack-hero">Backpack Hero</a>, which
successfully implements inventory organisation as a core aspect of
gameplay in a roguelite; and a game jam entry <a
href="https://thoof.itch.io/bag-of-holding">Bag of Holding</a>, closer
to my idea that it even has the same working title!</p>
<p>Yet still no falling shapes.</p>

<p>I decided on a fantasy medieval setting, so that the autobattler part
could be a well-understood dungeon crawl; and on a low-poly
(low-vertex?) 2D style, since it's simple and fast to make programmer
art for!</p>
<p>The primary gameplay loop so far superficially resembles the Tetris
arrangement, where the player has a game grid (the bag) into which
shapes (items) fall, and a queue displaying the shape/s that are to be
deposited in the game grid.</p>
<p>Whereas in the case of Tetris the next shape/s are determined
directly, at random or by some algorithm, the items to be delivered to
the bag in this game are determined by the procession of the autobattler
element. This is still random at its root, but provides the potential
for the player to influence the generation of items in an intuitive
manner.</p>
<p>A further difference from classic Tetris gameplay is that the falling
speed of the items is not determined simply by how much progress the
player has made. I wanted to include this aspect of challenge, but in a
manner which could be ameliorated by the player's actions, and also tied
to the autobattler. Thus a "queue pressure" system is used, where the
speed of the falling item depends on the number of looted items waiting
to be dropped. This punishes the player for dawdling about placing
items, rather than punishing the player simply for playing well.</p>

<p>As it stands in the initial alpha release, each game session is
called an "adventure", and each of these autobattled adventures has two
possible endings - either the items in the bag overflow, in which case
the hero notices and leaves the dungeon with their loot; or else the
hero falls in combat with the denizens of the dungeon.</p>
<p>Thus, the player must balance acquiring and organising loot with
strategically arranging for the bag to overflow before it's too
late!</p>

<p>For those wanting to try it out for themselves, I've made executables
available as <a href="https://romlok.itch.io/bagofholding">Bag of
Holding on Itch</a>, though I've only been able to personally test the
Linux binary, so YMMV.</p>
<h4 id="combat">Combat</h4>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">RIP</figcaption>

<p>Right now, combat is very simple and deterministic. Both the hero and
the enemies do a static amount of damage and have a static amount of
health (though "Custom adventures" can modify these fixed values).</p>
<p>I intend to keep combat simple, automatic, and likely deterministic,
but the intention is for the player to be able to influence the hero to
keep them alive, so affecting combat with actions such as switching
weapons and drinking potions is the ultimate aim.</p>
<h3 id="to-be-implemented">To be implemented</h3>
<p>While the future of the project is still somewhat uncertain, I have
developed not so much a plan as a set of ideas for making this into a
more complete game.</p>
<h4 id="opening-the-bag">Opening the bag</h4>
<p><img src="/img/bag-of-holding/potion.png" /></p>
<p>I toyed with ideas of how the <del>Tetris</del> <em>legally distinct
falling shape puzzle</em> aspect could work, since there needs to be a
way for items to <em>leave</em> the bag, for dungeon crawls to last more
than a couple of minutes.</p>
<p>I considered Tetris-like destruction of filled lines, but
"destroying" parts of items 1. didn't mesh well with the idea that the
hero's going to be selling this stuff; and 2. would require a
significant rewrite as to how equipment was implemented in game.</p>
<p>One related alternative was that only whole items could be sent to
the void. I could only see two ways of this working however: either an
item is removed when it contributes to a finished line; or an item is
removed only when all the lines it contributes to are finished.
Unfortunately, I see the former as being far too easy to clear the bag,
and the latter as far too difficult!</p>
<p>Another alternative I considered was for sharp items like swords to
be able to cut holes in the bag itself, letting items fall out! This
would make placement and orientation of items even more meaningful,
which appeals to me, but feels like it could make the gameplay too
chaotic and prone to catastrophic errors, and detract from the
organisational aspect.</p>
<p><img src="/img/bag-of-holding/big_axe.png" /></p>
<p>Additionally, all of these options flew in the face of another
gameplay aspect I wanted to adopt - that the player can nudge the
behaviour of the hero by having them take an item (weapon, healing
potion, etc.) out of the bag to use.</p>
<p>Thus, being able to physically lift items out of the bag, as a
reversal of the dropping mechanism, was considered. However, this
conflicts and interferes with the gameplay loop of items constantly
falling, and the time/speed pressure that can be applied there. Further,
without some kind of physics implementation, only the topmost layer of
items could be lifted, limiting the organisational strategies available
to the player.</p>
<p>So the current plan is simply to use magic! The player will highlight
an item that has settled in the bag, prompting the hero to pull it out
when they have a chance. At that point the item will simply disappear
from the bag, and items above it in the game grid will start falling
again, and/or leave awkward spaces. This adds the gameplay dimension
that the player needs to consider possible future removal of items when
organising the bag content!</p>
<h4 id="exploration">Exploration</h4>
<p><img src="/img/bag-of-holding/rocks.png" /></p>
<p>The current dungeon is linear, but branching could be added with the
inclusion of keys and side-doors. For example, the player uses a key as
the hero is approaching a side-door, and instead of continuing on the
current path, the hero will unlock and enter a door to a different
region of the dungeon.</p>
<h4 id="metagame">Metagame</h4>
<p><img src="/img/bag-of-holding/coin.png" /></p>
<p>Apparently every autobattler needs metagame progression, and this
concept seems rife with possibilities for variations and progression:
hero classes, hero traits, starting equipment, bag size, queue size,
etc.</p>
<p>Talk about scope creep!</p>
