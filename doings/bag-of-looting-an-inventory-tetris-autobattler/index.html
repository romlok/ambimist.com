<p><a href="https://romlok.itch.io/bagoflooting">Bag of Looting</a> is a
game I created over the summer of '23. It combines the falling-shape
mechanic of Tetris with a side-scrolling autobattler and a
meta-progression system.</p>
<p>As with most games in the Tetris family, the core gameplay involves
the arrangement of falling shapes within a limited grid. However, the
autobattler aspect is used to determine both the type and rate of
incoming shapes, and to provide the mechanism for clear space in the
primary gameplay grid.</p>

<p>Watching streamers play <a
href="https://www.escapefromtarkov.com/">Escape from Tarkov</a> and
seeing how much time they spent sorting and rearranging their inventory,
when compared to time spent actually playing the game, it inspired me to
wonder "what if sorting the inventory <em>was</em> the game? What if the
raids were just played out automatically?"</p>
<p>It seems like Resident Evil fans are all over inventory organisation,
with games like <a
href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1955330/Save_Room__Organization_Puzzle/">Save
Room</a>, and <a
href="https://residentevilmodding.boards.net/thread/16458/resident-evil-tetris-edition-v2">a
random fan game with falling blocks</a>.</p>
<p>Others followed through on similar ideas, such as <a
href="https://thejaspel.itch.io/backpack-hero">Backpack Hero</a>, which
successfully implements inventory organisation as a core aspect of
gameplay in a roguelite; and a game jam entry <a
href="https://thoof.itch.io/bag-of-holding">Bag of Holding</a>, closer
to my idea that it even had the same working title!</p>
<p>However, I could find no game which combined the challenge of
arranging Tetris-like falling shapes with the metagame of an
autobattler. So with a pioneering spirit, my mind wandered forth!</p>

<p>I decided on a fantasy medieval setting, so that the autobattler part
could be a well-understood dungeon crawl; and on a low-poly
(low-vertex?) 2D style, since it's simple and fast to make art for!</p>
<p>The primary gameplay loop superficially resembles the Tetris
arrangement, where the player has a game grid (the bag) into which
shapes (items) fall, and a queue displaying the shape/s that are next to
be deposited in the game grid.</p>
<p>Where Bag of Looting begins to diverge is that the items to be
delivered to the bag are determined by the procession of the autobattler
element, rather than being determined directly as in the case of Tetris.
This is still random at its root, but provides the potential for the
player to influence the generation of items in an intuitive manner.</p>
<p>Another major difference from classic Tetris gameplay is that the
falling speed of the items is not determined simply by how much progress
the player has made. I wanted to include this aspect of challenge, but
in a manner which could be ameliorated by the player's actions, and also
tied to the autobattler. Thus a "queue pressure" system is used, where
the speed of the falling item depends on the number of looted items
waiting to be dropped. This punishes the player for dawdling about
placing items, rather than punishing the player simply for playing
well.</p>
<h4 id="making-room">Making room</h4>
<p><img src="/img/bag-of-looting/potion.png" /></p>
<p>For dungeon crawls to last more than a couple of minutes, there needs
to be a mechanism for space to be <em>cleared</em> in the bag.</p>
<p>I considered Tetris-like destruction of filled lines, but
"destroying" parts of items: 1. didn't mesh well with the idea that the
adventurer is going to be selling this stuff; and 2. would require a
significant rewrite as to how equipment was already implemented in the
prototypes!</p>
<p>One related alternative was that only whole items could be sent to
the void. I could only see two ways of this working however: Either an
item is removed when it contributes to a finished line; or an item is
removed only when all the lines it contributes to are finished.
Unfortunately, I see the former as being far too easy to clear the bag,
and the latter as far too difficult!</p>
<p>Another alternative I considered was for sharp items like swords to
be able to cut holes in the bag itself, letting items fall out! This
would make placement and orientation of items even more meaningful,
which appeals to me, but feels like it could make the gameplay too
chaotic and prone to catastrophic errors!</p>
<p><img src="/img/bag-of-looting/big_axe.png" /></p>
<p>Additionally, all of these options flew in the face of another
gameplay aspect I wanted to adopt - that the player can nudge the
behaviour of the adventurer by having them take an item (weapon, healing
potion, etc.) out of the bag to use.</p>
<p>Thus, being able to physically lift items out of the bag, as a
reversal of the dropping mechanism, was considered. However, this
conflicts and interferes with the gameplay loop of items constantly
falling, and the time/speed pressure that can be applied there. Further,
without some kind of physics implementation, only the topmost layer of
items could be lifted, limiting the organisational strategies available
to the player.</p>
<p>So instead the game uses a simple select-and-retrieve system. The
player can click an item that has settled in the bag, which will prompt
the adventurer to equip it the next time they have a moment. At that
point the item will simply disappear from the bag, and items above it in
the game grid will start falling again, and/or leave awkward spaces.
This adds the gameplay dimension that the player needs to consider
possible future removal of items when organising the bag content!</p>

<p>The autobattler aspect itself consists of an adventurer - with no
sense of self-preservation - moving through a dungeon, searching
objects, fighting monsters, and looting corpses.</p>
<p>The dungeon itself is completely linear, randomly populated with
encounters of progressively increasing difficulty and increasing reward.
It ends with the inevitable boss monster, whose defeat heralds the end
of the game.</p>
<p>The player is able to influence the autobattler through only two
means: Allowing the bag to overflow, causing the adventurer to leave the
dungeon at their next opportunity; or through selecting items in the
bag, which the adventurer will then equip and use when they have a
moment.</p>

<p>I enjoy progression systems in games, both for the sense of continual
improvement, and also for allowing more moderately skilled players to
experience the whole of a game by providing gradual increases in the
player's relative power.</p>
<p>Thus I added a meta-progression campaign, to provide an overview over
game completion and discovery/unlocks, and upgrades to make the
expeditions easier and last longer.</p>
<p>However, the meta-game is progressed only when the adventurer leaves
the dungeon alive. Thus the player must balance acquiring and organising
loot - for use or sale - with strategically arranging for the bag to
overflow before it's too late!</p>
<h3 id="development-process">Development process</h3>
<p>I've written up my thoughts and experiences regarding the development
process. It is quite extensive (read: wordy), so lives as a separate
article to this. You can find it at both <a
href="https://romlok.itch.io/bagoflooting/devlog/611491/post-mortem-reflections">"Post-mortem
reflections" on Itch.io</a> and <a
href="/doings/bag-of-looting-postmortem/">"Bag of Looting postmortem" on
this very site</a>.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>For now I consider Bag of Looting to be complete. There is of course
much more that could be added or improved, but this was never intended
to be a long-term project. I had the good fortune to have both
motivation and free time coincide long enough to push this through to
where it is, and I'm happy with how it turned out.</p>
